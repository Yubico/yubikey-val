    Resolving this problem protects (arguably buggy) clients against
    an attack.  Prior versions of the Yubico C and PHP clients do not
    appear to exhibit this bug.  We provide an analysis of the issue
    below so that you can review client implementations for the
    problem.  Note that you do not have to fix clients if you are
    using this server version (or later), although we recommend it
    anyway.

    If the client sends a OTP value that ends with '%0astatus=OK' the
    server output will contain a line 'status=ok' before the real
    status code status=MISSING_PARAMETER.  Note lower-casing of the
    injected status code, so that it doesn't match a correct
    'status=OK' response.  Note also that the OTP value would fail
    normal input validation checks in the client.

    If the client sends a NONCE value that ends with '%0astatus=OK'
    the output will contain a line consisting of 'status=OK' before
    the correct status=MISSING_PARAMETER.  However, the NONCE value is
    generated by client code internally and does not come from any
    untrusted source, thus the impact here is limited -- if an
    attacker is able to trick a client into sending a crafted NONCE
    value the attacker is normally able to modify the client code
    somehow, and can thus trick the client in other ways as well.
    Similar issues apply to the ID field, which is normally also under
    control of the trusted client code and not something an attacker
    could influence.

    Thus, this server-side fix solve a client-side issue that we
    believe would only occur when both of these conditions are true:

    1) the client does not do proper input validation of the OTP, and
    2) the client incorrectly parses 'status=ok' as 'status=OK'.

    or when the following condition is true

    A) the client can be tricked into sending a crafted NONCE or ID
    value.
